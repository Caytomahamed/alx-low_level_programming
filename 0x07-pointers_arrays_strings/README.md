# Pointer and Arrays

Hello,

In this Task, we will discuss some important concepts related to pointers and arrays in the C programming language. Specifically, we will cover the following topics:
`
1. Pointer to Pointer
2. Multi-Dimensional Arrays in C
3. Two-Dimensional (2D) Arrays in C Programming
`

## Pointer to Pointer
In C, a pointer is a variable that holds the memory address of another variable. However, it is also possible to have a pointer that points to another pointer. This is known as a pointer to pointer or a double pointer.

A pointer to pointer is declared using the syntax data_type **pointer_name. For example, if we want to declare a pointer to pointer that points to an integer value, we can use the following syntax:

```
int **pptr;
```

To assign a value to a double pointer, we need to use the address-of operator (&) twice. For example, consider the following code:

```
int x = 10;
int *ptr = &x;
int **pptr = &ptr;
```

Here, we have declared a integer variable x and a pointer ptr that points to x. We have also declared a pointer to pointer pptr that points to ptr.

## Multi-Dimensional Arrays in C
In C, we can declare arrays with more than one dimension. These are known as multi-dimensional arrays. We can declare a two-dimensional array using the syntax data_type array_name[row_size][column_size].

For example, if we want to declare a two-dimensional array that can store 3 rows and 4 columns of integer values, we can use the following syntax:

```
int array[3][4];
```

We can access individual elements in a two-dimensional array using the row and column indices. For example, to access the element in the second row and third column of array, we can use the following syntax:

```
int element = array[1][2];
```

## Two-Dimensional (2D) Arrays in C Programming
Two-dimensional arrays are a special case of multi-dimensional arrays where the array has two dimensions or axes. They can be thought of as a table or grid of values.

To declare a two-dimensional array in C, we use the syntax data_type array_name[row_size][column_size].

For example, consider the following code:

```
int matrix[3][3] = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
```

Here, we have declared a two-dimensional array matrix that can store 3 rows and 3 columns of integer values. We have initialized the values of the array using an initializer list.

To access an individual element in a two-dimensional array, we use the syntax array_name[row_index][column_index]. For example, to access the element in the second row and third column of matrix, we can use the following syntax:

```
int element = matrix[1][2];
```
