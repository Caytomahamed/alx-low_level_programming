# Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It can be used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems that are similar to the original problem.

## Recursion consists of two main parts:

```
Base case: This is the stopping condition that ends the recursion. It is a simple case that can be solved directly without further recursion.

Recursive case: This is the case where the function calls itself with a smaller or simpler version of the original problem. The function continues to call itself until the base case is reached.
```

Recursion is often used in algorithms that traverse or search through data structures such as trees, graphs, and linked lists. It can also be used to solve problems that involve a repeated pattern or sequence.

Recursion can be a powerful tool in programming, but it can also be inefficient or lead to stack overflow errors if not implemented properly. It is important to ensure that the base case is reachable and that the recursive case eventually reaches the base case to avoid infinite recursion.

In summary, recursion is a programming technique that involves a function calling itself to solve a problem. It consists of a base case and a recursive case, and can be used to solve problems that involve a repeated pattern or sequence.
